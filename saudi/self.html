                    <p><img src="selflove.jpg" alt="self" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;">
                        <p>This is a letter from the 19-year-old you, the 19-year-old you who was lost, who was insecure, who was looking for her voice. I hope the future you has become everything that you have ever dreamed of--someone who is comfortable in her own skin, someone who is not afraid to voice out her opinions, someone who is genuinely happy. I hope your love for writing never dies, and that you continue to use this talent for the good of others. Always remember that you are loved, and that it is never wrong to give back the love that you have received, as long as you leave some for yourself.</p>
